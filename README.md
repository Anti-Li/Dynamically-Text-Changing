# Dynamically-Text-Changing

This about using JS(a little CSS) to make change text dynamically, look the main page of https://www.microsoft.com/net to see moreï¼Œ because these  pull away and spin off the module of [SourceCode](view-source:www.microsoft.com/net). Thanks again for some CSS from MIT and some js from Microsoft.
